## Project Overview

C.R.I.S.P. is a system consiting of set of probes and their Controling Interface. The system is engineered to assist search and rescue teams in navigating debris fields caused by earthquakes and other natural calamities where human access is restricted or hazardous.

The platform facilitates real-time coordination of multiple units to locate survivors and map unstable environments using advanced localization techniques.

## Technical Core
* **Mesh Networking:** The probes utilize a decentralized mesh network, ensuring stable communication and data relay even in environments where traditional cellular or GPS signals are obstructed by heavy debris.
* **SLAM Integration:** Each unit employs Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to generate real-time spatial data of the disaster zone, allowing the operator to visualize the layout of the debris internally.

## Operational Features
The C.R.I.S.P. interface supports the following tactical operations for the probe fleet:

* **Recall All:** Synchronized return of all active units to the primary deployment site.
* **Global Stop:** Immediate cessation of all probe movement for safety or data stabilization.
* **Tactical Containment (Alt + Select):** Precision command to surround a specific coordinate or identified heat signature.
*  **Base RTB:** All the probes return back to their primary deployment site via shortest route.  
* **Live Visual Feed:** Direct high-latency-optimized video transmission from probe-mounted cameras.
* **Advanced Formations:**
    * **CircularForm:** For 360-degree surveillance of a specific point of interest.
    * **Wedge Form:** Designed for directional debris penetration and clearing.
* **Fleet Sweep:** A systematic search protocol where probes disperse to maximize surface area coverage and signal detection.
